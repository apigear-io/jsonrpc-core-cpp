# Json RPC Core C++ Library

The design goal of this library is to write a JSON RPC protocol only to depend on Std C++11 and nlohman JSON library. No other external dependencies. 

All external dependencies are designed as interfaces to ensure this library can be easily integrated into other technology stacks.


# Usage

See Qt Demo App (example/QRpcApp)
